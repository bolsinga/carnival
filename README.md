This program is based upon the program I made in April, 1992. It ran on big & powerful 
Silicon Graphics (SGI) machines. It was written in a SGI SPI called Iris GL. Over the
last 11 years, Iris GL evolved into OpenGL. OpenGL is supported on just about every
computer out there today.

I had the sources from 1992, and I decided to get them running on Mac OS X. It took 
about 2 days of programming.

To run, just double click on the carnival application. Once it is running, you are
first riding the roller coaster. Pressing the 't' key will switch you to riding the
ferris wheel, and pressing the 't' key again will bring you back ot the roller
coaster. Pressing the Space Bar will pause the animation. Pressing the 's' key will 
set up the program so that you can look around using the arrow keys for left and right
and up and down. Using the 'z' and 'x' keys will move the camera forwards and
backwards in space. It is a little unusual to look around. I don't have the math quite
right, and it can get into an odd position fairly easily. Simply press the Space Bar
to start the animation up again.

An interesting fact is that I had to force this program to slow down. Without a forced
slowdown in the code (which wasn't there on the super fast SGI machines of 11 years ago),
it would draw so fast that it is hard to tell what is going on.

I put a video of the result on YouTube: https://youtu.be/4mO8TaWTE5Y.
